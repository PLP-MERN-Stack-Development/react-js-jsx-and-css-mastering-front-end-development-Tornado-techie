## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up and run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PLP-MERN-Stack-Development/react-js-jsx-and-css-mastering-front-end-development-Tornado-techie.git
    cd react-js-jsx-and-css-mastering-front-end-development-Tornado-techie
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will usually open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173/` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will generate optimized static assets in the `dist` directory.

### Deployment to GitHub Pages

To deploy your application to GitHub Pages, you can use the `deploy` script:

```bash
npm run deploy
# or
yarn deploy
```

Ensure your `package.json` has the `homepage` field correctly configured for GitHub Pages, and `gh-pages` is installed as a dev dependency.
